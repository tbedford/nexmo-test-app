# Nexmo simple Voice app

A Nexmo test application

Useful where you need a simple Voice application for testing purposes.

You call into the Nexmo number, you hear music, for ever. That's it. Also logs out all webhooks to console.

You need to create a `.env` file. That will contain NEXMO_NUMBER and AUDIO_URL.
