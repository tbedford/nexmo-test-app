# nexmo-test-app

A Nexmo test application

Useful where you need a simple Voice application for testing purposes.

You call into the Nexmo number, you hear music, for ever. That's it. 

Example use: Testing the Nexmo Proxy you would have Nexmo -> Proxy -> App. The App is any Nexmo app you want to proxy. This test app would do fine for that.
